This folder includes one application (buildmesh) and the graphics library it
uses (vcglib)

More information about VCG library can be obtained here:
http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/vcglib/

The application "buildmesh" is a slight modification of one of the example
applications VCG library provided.

Originally the program takes the input file of PLY format that contains only
vertices (points) and creates the output file of PLY format with triangle mesh
by connecting the original points using "ball pivoting" method.

With the modified form, it takes the input file of ASC format (which is just
a text file with X Y Z in each line for each point) and creates the output file
of OBJ format with triangle mesh using the same algorithm.

A simple CMakeLists.txt is provided to build the program "buildmesh", an
example usage is: From a build directory, LungShapeWorks-build, at the same
level of the source repository LungShapeWorks, type:

cmake ../LungShapeWorks/src/buildmesh && make

The executable will be built in LungShapeWorks-build. An example usage is:

./buildmesh test.asc test-out.obj -r 20.0 -c 0.2

Running ./buildmesh without arguments shows usage and meaning of the arguments
